# Troubleshooting Index

This index maps common **symptoms** to the existing troubleshooting page that
covers them. It does not duplicate any procedure — every entry links to an
existing guide. Use this page as the entry point when you know *what* is going
wrong but not *which document* explains how to fix it.

> **How to use:** Find the symptom that matches what you are seeing, then follow
> the link to the relevant guide. Each guide contains the full procedure, error
> messages, and remediation steps.

## Stable error-code reference

Every structured Glassbox error carries a stable `Code` (automation contract) that
you can key on instead of parsing free-form text. Codes are grouped below by
symptom area; the full catalogue with exit codes is in
[Stable Error Codes](./stable-error-codes.md).

| Area | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | `SIMULATOR_NOT_FOUND` | Simulator binary absent or not executable |
| Setup | `SOURCE_DISCOVERY_FAILED` | Source mapping unavailable for contract |
| RPC | `RPC_CONNECTION_FAILED` | Endpoint unreachable |
| RPC | `RPC_TIMEOUT` | Request timed out |
| RPC | `ALL_RPC_FAILED` | All failover endpoints failed |
| RPC | `RPC_ERROR` | RPC server returned a non-200 / error response |
| RPC | `TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND` | TX hash not found on the selected network |
| RPC | `LEDGER_NOT_FOUND` | Ledger sequence unavailable |
| RPC | `LEDGER_ARCHIVED` | Ledger has been archived |
| RPC | `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | RPC rate limit hit |
| RPC | `UNAUTHORIZED` | Missing or invalid auth token |
| RPC | `INVALID_NETWORK` | Unrecognised `--network` value |
| RPC | `NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` | Named network has no known endpoint |
| Session | `SESSION_WRITE_CONFLICT` | Concurrent writer saved a newer revision |
| Session | `SESSION_LOCK_HELD` | Advisory lock held by a live process |

Exit-code taxonomy: 0 = success, 1 = user error, 2 = config/environment error,
3 = internal/runtime error, 130 = interrupted (SIGINT). See
[Exit Codes](./exit-codes.md) for the full mapping.

## Command-help reference

When you know the flag or command but want to confirm accepted values and
defaults, run:

```bash
glassbox debug --help          # all debug flags and their defaults
glassbox --help                # global flags (--profile, --log-level, --json, ...)
glassbox session --help        # session subcommands
glassbox audit:sign --help     # signing flags
glassbox protocol:diagnose     # glassbox:// registration status
glassbox doctor                # comprehensive environment health check
```

For machine-readable output pipe through `--json` or `--format json`, then key
on `error.code` in the JSON envelope (see
[Stable Error Codes — Output adapters](./stable-error-codes.md#output-adapters)).
